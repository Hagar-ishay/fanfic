## Rule: Browser Testing Requirement

Use the Browser MCP tools frequently to verify implementations in the actual development environment:

- Take screenshots to verify visual appearance
- Test responsive behavior at different screen sizes
- Verify interactive elements work correctly
- Check mobile drawer vs desktop dialog behavior
- Validate forms, navigation, and user flows work as expected
