## Rule: Code Quality Verification

Always run linting and type checking before considering any task complete:

- Run `pnpm run lint` to check ESLint rules
- Run type checking (likely `pnpm run typecheck` or similar)
- Fix all errors and warnings before proceeding
- Never commit or mark tasks as complete with linting/type errors
