## Rule: Mobile-First Responsive Design

This application prioritizes mobile experience while ensuring desktop functionality. When implementing features:

- Design for mobile screens first (320px+)
- Use responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:) for desktop enhancements
- Test both mobile and desktop layouts using browser dev tools
- Ensure touch-friendly interactions (min 44px touch targets)
- Verify drawer/dialog behavior works correctly on both platforms
