## Rule: Development Server Assumption

The development server is already running at localhost:3000 (or similar). Never attempt to start the dev server with `pnpm dev`:

- Always assume the server is running and accessible
- Use browser tools to navigate to the running application
- If the server appears down, ask the user rather than attempting to start it
