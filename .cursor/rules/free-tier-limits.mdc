## Rule: Vercel/Neon Free Tier Limitations

Be mindful of free tier constraints when implementing features:

- Vercel free tier: Maximum 2 cron jobs total
- Neon free tier: Database storage and connection limits
- Consider these limitations when suggesting scheduled tasks or heavy database operations
- Optimize database queries for efficiency
- Be conservative with automated/scheduled features
